# StockIndicatorAnalysis

Here is a program which calculates the MACD and RSI of a stock
It then determines whether the MACD has crossed the signal line, as well as if the stock is underbought or overbought
This is not be used for trading
It was created with the intention of further building upon my programming skills whilst also learning more about the analytical side of the stock market
